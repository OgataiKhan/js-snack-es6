# Javascript Snacks

This is part of a series of small exercises meant to practice specific aspects of Javascript.

## Snack 1

This script will pinpoint the lightest bicycle from an array of objects and print it into the DOM.

1. Create the array of objects.  
2. Initialize a "lightestBike" variable representing the first object in the data array.  
3. Run a "forEach" cycle to change the "lightestBike" variable to represent the first bike it encounters with the lowest weight.  
4. Use filter to create an array of all the bicycles with the lowest weight.  
5. Use a template literal to print the array into the DOM.

## Snack 2

This script will generate random numbers of "Goals Scored" and "Fouls Suffered" for an array of football teams. It will then create a new array containing only the team names and the fouls suffered, without the scored goals. This final array will be printed into the console.

1. Create the array of objects.  
2. Use forEach() to assign random integers between 0 and 10 to the "Goals Scored" and "Fouls Suffered" of each team.  
3. Use map() to create a teamsNew array that only includes team names and fouls. 
4. Print the new array into the console.
