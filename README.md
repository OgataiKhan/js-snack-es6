# Javascript Snacks

This is part of a series of small exercises meant to practice specific aspects of Javascript.

## Snack 1

This script will pinpoint the lightest bicycle from an array of objects and print it into the DOM.

1. Create the array of objects.  
2. Initialize a "lightestBike" variable representing the first object in the data array.  
3. Run a "forEach" cycle to change the "lightestBike" variable to represent the first bike it encounters with the lowest weight.  
4. Use filter to create an array of all the bicycles with the lowest weight.  
5. Use a template literal to print the array into the DOM.
